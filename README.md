Self Study Object Orientation Programming
=========================================

Getting Started
---------------
This project introduce myself with some object orientation programming concepts.
To be more familar within
These are the four main pilars of OO
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Heritance
- Polimorfism

The diference between OO and procedural programming its about performance. 
Of course the procedural its more fast than OO, becasue the procedural they 
have a fredom to chose the hardware.



### Initial Setup ###
1. Make a new virtualenv: ``python3.5 -m venv .venv``
2. Activate the virtualenv: ``source env/bin/activate``
3. Install: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
